# Barrel-Twister

*This repository contains models that can be printed with a 3D printer. Create the .stl files with [OpenScad](https://openscad.org/) or download them from [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6421590).*

A game similar to Rubiks Tower Twister.

This is the second version: The 'click mechanism' now works pretty well and the printing time is drastically reduced (only one part needs support, no part needs high resolution).

However, if your printer is not the most accurate or if you use old filament, be sure to take the time needed to remove all kind of blobs from the tiles and rings so that the tiles can slide easily. 



### The models, how to print

| Model name | Image                                                        | Notes                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Shaft      | ![Shaft](https://github.com/Moon70/Barrel-Twister/blob/main/images/Shaft.gif?raw=true) | no support, standard quality (0.2mm)                         |
| CoverRing  | ![CoverRing](https://github.com/Moon70/Barrel-Twister/blob/main/images/CoverRing.gif?raw=true) | no support, standard quality (0.2mm), print 2 times          |
| Ring       | ![Ring](https://github.com/Moon70/Barrel-Twister/blob/main/images/Ring.gif?raw=true)   | no support, standard quality (0.2mm), print 6 times          |
| Cap        | ![Cap](https://github.com/Moon70/Barrel-Twister/blob/main/images/Cap.gif?raw=true)     | no support, standard quality (0.2mm)                         |
| Tile       | ![Tile](https://github.com/Moon70/Barrel-Twister/blob/main/images/Tile.gif?raw=true)   | support, standard quality (0.2mm), use 6 colours and print 6 times each, except one colour only 5 times |



### Assembling is easy

![Assemble](https://github.com/Moon70/Barrel-Twister/blob/main/images/Assemble.png?raw=true)

Be sure to insert the tiles before mounting the second CoverRing on the last Ring. Finally, use 3 screws to fix the Cap, but don´t screw together too tightly. The screws, I think, are 3x15 mm, I used some from old VHS video tapes.

Finally, I want to repeat myself: Take the time necessary to remove all kind of blobs especially if you use old filament. If the tiles don´t slide easily, use sandpaper.
