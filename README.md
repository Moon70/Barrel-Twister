A game similar to Rubiks Tower Twister.

Before downloading/printing this game, please note this is version 1 and IÂ´m currently working on version 2. This version is playable, but the 'click mechanism' does not work properly, not like the testprint did. While this could be fixed by changing some parameters of the 'click mechanism', I want to implement some more features:

- print models with default quality to decrease printing time (current 'click mechanism' needs high resolution)
- print models without support
- the 6 turnable rings are fixed between two black rings, which are somehow annoying while playing, and therefore should be removed
